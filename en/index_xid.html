<h2 style="font-size: 50px;">How to Respond to Tiananmen Trolls</h2>

<div class="descripe">

<p>On June 4th every year, the world comes together to commemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre, mourn the pro-democracy protesters who were killed, and condemn the totalitarian rule of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). However, a propaganda drive to whitewash the Tiananmen massacre also kicks in at the same time on social media and private messenger groups, to speak up for the CCP and to admonish the students in the pro-democracy movement. </p>



<p>Doublethink Lab has collated messages intended to whitewash CCP’s atrocities, and were able to categorize them into three groups, each with their own motives and narrative strategies.</p>

<h2>Evade</h2>

<div class="descripe">

<p>Individuals who use this method will disagree with what you say at every turn. If you raise questions, they will dodge your questions; and if you keep up with the questioning, they will question your logic. In other words, the idea is to beat around the bush and expend time and energy, so as to evade addressing the real question.</p>

<p>There are two tactics that are used: Zoom In, where the other party would take aim at minor issues so as to evade discussing the larger issue; and Zoom Out, where everything but the kitchen sink is thrown into the discussion, causing the discussion to lose focus.</p>

<h1>Nitpicking</h1>

<p>In this example, the other party posts a screenshot to show that it is possible to search about the Tiananmen Square massacre on the Baidu search engine in China, as an attempt to prove that news relating to the Tiananmen Square massacre is not blocked in China.</p>

<div class="inline-gallery1-1">

<h1 class="suggested-response">Based on the screenshot you showed, this search turned up the "Tiananmen Square disturbance" (六四風波) instead of the "Tiananmen Square massacre". Doesn’t this demonstrate that the Chinese government is indeed downplaying the massacre?</h1>



<p>If you were to engage the poster directly, this might instead turn into a debate over whether the screenshot was altered, which would distract from the real issue at hand: that even as the Tiananmen Square massacre can be discussed behind the Chinese Great Firewall, it can only be done so on official government platforms and in a manner permitted by the government.</p> 



<p>It is clear from the screenshot that the Tiananmen Square massacre is being discussed as a "disturbance" instead of a "massacre" or "brutal suppression". The best method to counter this poster is to respond with a reliable article or documentary of the massacre, in order to allow other people involved in the conversation to discern the facts for themselves.</p>

<h5>Nitpicking</h5>

<p>Under this tactic, the other party tries to pick apart the logic of our argument, even to the extent of picking on our word use. If we were to respond to each of their arguments, then we would have fallen into their trap. The way to handle this situation is to refocus the discussion.</p>

<p>This particular poster showed a news clipping falsely claiming the death of student activist Wang Dan during the Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, as evidence that the Tiananmen Square massacre is a hoax.</p>

<h1 class="suggested-response">You assume the Tiananmen Square massacre is a hoax simply from one article? Isn’t that a major leap of logic?</h1>

<p>This is a slippery slope argument—just bringing out one false piece of news does not make the Tiananmen Square massacre a hoax. We can apply the same slippery argument back on the other party, and use other examples to confront them of their illogic.</p>

<p>In response to such tactics, we need to put the responsibility back onto the Chinese government. Being drawn into a discussion by the poster will stray from the main topic of discussion. </p>

<p>Even though there have been other examples of oppression and massacres in ancient China, discussion about the Tiananmen Square massacre is something the Chinese government wants to suppress, which is why it is being commemorated on platforms not within the control of the CCP.</p>

<p>The appeal to hypocrisy is also a tactic used to divert attention from the real issue at hand. Democracies are an easy target since differences of opinions are allowed, and can be taken advantage of by opponents as weak points for attack.</p>

<p>A more appropriate response is to emphasize that people living in democracies have freedom of speech, and that everyone has the right to comment on issues. Then, bring the topic of discussion back to the Tiananmen Square massacre.</p>

<h1 class="suggested-response">It is indeed important to pay attention to the issue of racial discrimination in support of human rights. However, the actions by the Chinese government during the Tiananmen Square massacre, and its human rights abuses, run counter to your viewpoints. I am very glad to welcome you to join us in this struggle for freedom and democracy.</h1>

<p>Such tactics can be difficult to respond to. The reality is that any dominant group, be it white, male, middle-class, heterosexual, etc., will feel discomfort when confronted with such claims, for fear of being labeled the oppressor, due in part to the awareness that oppression is usually conducted by dominant groups in society.</p>

<p>However, in such an instance, the people whitewashing the Tiananmen Square massacre are not really concerned about human rights issues, and are using racial discourse to incite emotional responses, as a means to distract from the culpability of the Chinese government. </p>

<p>We therefore need to bring back to focus the issue at hand. </p>

<h1 class="suggested-response">Indeed, there are definitely military and police personnel who deserve our respect, and I pay tribute to them as well. In fact, it is the high-level government officials who should be held responsible for all the casualties resulting from the Tiananmen Square massacre, for not being willing to face the masses, and then sending the troops in, resulting in further casualties. </h1>

<p>In response to such narratives, we need to bring into the discussion the people in power who forced the people to take to the streets, and who ordered the military and police to suppress them. The responsibility for the casualties must be placed squarely on the people in power.</p>

<p>If there is reliable data that can be found, they can also be provided to highlight the ratio of casualties between the military and police, and the masses.</p>

<h5>Siding with the the People's Liberation Army</h5>

<p>There is a narrative that emphasizes that the people who should be commemorated during the Tiananmen Square incident are the military and police personnel who died. This tactic pits the military and police against the masses, as a means to weaken the legitimacy of the resistance. </p>

<h1 class="suggested-response">Taiwan has also undergone the arduous process of democratization, and has witnessed numerous large scale protests.

<p>To counter such perspectives, we can use the example of Taiwan or other democratic countries to highlight that societies can continue to maintain peace and stability even as bloody massacres and violent suppression have not been used to quell mass protests. In fact, if the government responds and changes according to the will of the people, this could even lead to better outcomes.</p>
